# WEB-technologies-FMI-project
This repository contains my project for the WEB technologies course at FMI.
The task was to create a system for planning and realizing trips with the option to add trip stops.
My implementation has a login system, a page for creating new trips and a page for reviewing all trips belonging to
the logged in account. Additionally you can add a photo and a comment for each stop.
